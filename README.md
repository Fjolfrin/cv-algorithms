# Computer Vision Algorithms and Methods

This repository contains various algorithms and methods that are used in Computer Vision (CV) applications. It aims both at personal practice, and at aiding anyone in search of code implementations of such methods.

As this is a personal project, the list of implemented methods will grow in time, so do not be undewhelmed by a short list!

Any suggestions for method additions or alterations are welcome! Please add an issue/feature request if you have want to make any comment.

**Implemented methods**
- Convolution (1D/2D)
- More methods coming up!
